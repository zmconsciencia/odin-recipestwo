# odin-recipestwo
second try
This is my very first odin project, on a surface level it's just a HTML website about some recipes, but in reality it will not only test my html skill that i've learned over the past few lessons but also the interaction with git and the linux terminal, my ambition is to fastly make a well-scrutured website and organize my file all through the linux terminal, and have them be well organized.

Ok its been about 1 hour and I really had no problems other than commiting the files because of a lack of braincells but we move on.
